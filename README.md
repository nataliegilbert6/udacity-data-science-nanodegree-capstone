## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using three Starbucks Datasets to answer the following questions:

- Which age group took the most advantage of the offers?
- Of the age group(s) that completed offers, which offers did they take most advantage of?
- How many males vs females took action on offers?
- What channels are most likely to lead customers to complete offers?
- Are customers influenced by the minimum spend requirement of an offer, or even by the offer amount? Do either of these metrics affect the likelihood that they will use an offer?

The datasets are the following: 

- profile dataset — Rewards program users (17000 users x 5 fields)
- portfolio dataset — Offers sent during 30-day test period (10 offers x 6 fields)
- transcript dataset — Event log (306648 events x 4 fields)

In addition to exploring the data, I trained four machine learning models to predict whether or not a customer will respond to an offer from Starbucks. I posted
my findings via a blog post on Medium, which hopefully provides readers with useful insights into how data can help predict how people will respond to certain offers.
